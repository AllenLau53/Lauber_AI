# Lauber_AI
An experimental ai built by two bright, weird young teens fascinated by AIs and complex math like calculus.
We also have absolutely no clue what we're doing, as we don't have much experience programming, and know mostly theory,
so specific feedback about what we're doing wrong would be very nice, actually.
We'll try to be clear in the comments, but this is the first large project we've collaborated on.
