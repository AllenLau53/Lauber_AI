# Lauber_AI
An experimental ai built by a bright, weird young teen fascinated by AIs and complex math like calculus.
I also have absolutely no clue what I'm doing, as I don't have much experience programming, and know mostly theory,
so specific feedback about what I'm doing wrong would be very nice, actually.
I'll try to be clear in my comments, but I'm still new at this.
